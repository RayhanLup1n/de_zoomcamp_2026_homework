## Question 7: 
Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?
- Big Query
- Container Registry
- **GCP Bucket**
- Big Table

**Answer:** `GCP Bucket`

**Reasoning:** External tables point to data stored outside of BigQuery's internal storage. In this case, the data resides in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
