## 📝 Running the Solutions

Each module folder contains specific instructions. In general, to run the environments locally:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
2.  **Spin up the database environment**:
    ```bash
    cd 01-docker-sql-terraform-gcp-homework
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3.  **Run ingestion tasks**:
